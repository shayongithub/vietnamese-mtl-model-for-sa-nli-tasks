  "description": "Students\u2019 feedback is a vital resource for the interdisciplinary research involving the combining of two different\nresearch fields between sentiment analysis and education.\n\nVietnamese Students\u2019 Feedback Corpus (UIT-VSFC) is the resource consists of over 16,000 sentences which are\nhuman-annotated with two different tasks: sentiment-based and topic-based classifications.\n\nTo assess the quality of our corpus, we measure the annotator agreements and classification evaluation on the\nUIT-VSFC corpus. As a result, we obtained the inter-annotator agreement of sentiments and topics with more than over\n91% and 71% respectively. In addition, we built the baseline model with the Maximum Entropy classifier and achieved\napproximately 88% of the sentiment F1-score and over 84% of the topic F1-score.",
